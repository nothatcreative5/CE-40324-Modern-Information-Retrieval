# CE-40324 - Modern Information Retrieval Course Assignments

## Assignment 1
A simple search engine for AI and Bioinformatics papers that uses different ranking functions, including SMART and Okapi-25. The code also incorporates Gamma and Variable Byte encoding to compress the index and improve performance. Additionally, the search engine includes a spelling correction feature using bigram indexing.

## Assignment 2

Classification: We used Naive Bayes for categorizing the papers based on their content.

MLP with FastText: Utilizing FastText word embeddings, we trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to classify the papers.

Fine-tuning BERT: We experimented with fine-tuning BERT, both with and without freezing weights, to improve the classification accuracy of the papers.

IR Search in Different Categories: We implemented an Information Retrieval (IR) system that allowed users to search for papers within specific categories.

Clustering with K-means: After retrieving search results, we applied the K-means clustering algorithm to group similar papers together.
